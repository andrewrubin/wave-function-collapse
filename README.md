# Wave function collapse algorithm

WFC tile solver, implemented on a 2D canvas in JavaScript.

## TO-DO

- Neighbor cells must look ahead and influence _their_ neighbors' entropies as well. Right now it can fail because the algorithm only influences immediate neighbors of a cell.
- Add better-looking tiles.
